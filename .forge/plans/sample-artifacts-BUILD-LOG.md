**Commit:** 1421277

### Section 2: Spec files — ✅ DONE 2026-02-22
**Files created:** templates/sample-forge/specs/OVERVIEW.md, templates/sample-forge/specs/01-database.md

**Commit:** c9ec3f6

### Section 3: Plan artifacts (RESEARCH, PLAN, BUILD-LOG, VERIFY) — ✅ DONE 2026-02-22
**Files created:** templates/sample-forge/plans/database-RESEARCH.md, templates/sample-forge/plans/database-PLAN.md, templates/sample-forge/plans/database-BUILD-LOG.md, templates/sample-forge/plans/database-VERIFY.md
**Files modified:** none
**Tests:** 3 passing, 3 total (plan >= 4 sections, log >= 2 entries, verify has mixed results)
**Deviations from plan:** PLAN.md shows section 1 as ✅ (plan said "one marked complete") — consistent. VERIFY.md has ⚠️ partial (plan said "mixed results with ❌ or ⚠️") — used ⚠️ which is more realistic than a hard failure for a verified component.
